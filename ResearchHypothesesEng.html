        <div>
            <p class="paragraph">Electricity can be generated by installing a floating platform or buoy on the ocean's surface, using the kinetic energy of waves that make it sway. This is called wave or hydro energy. Although the principle is similar to wind energy, as it utilizes the undulations of waves, the energy generated by water is far more significant than that produced by wind due to the increased mass of water compared to air. These wave energy converters sway with the waves, thus converting kinetic energy into electrical energy, which is then directed to the main station via underwater cables.
                However, it faces several issues, such as algae attaching to it, and sharks or other fish biting it, in addition to maintenance difficulties due to underwater parts.
                Moreover, the generator acts as a device for detecting natural disasters before they occur, saving the lives of thousands of people.
                Although most of the Earth's surface is covered with water, wave energy remains largely untapped, and if used properly, it could represent a major breakthrough in the field of new energy sources.

            <p class="paragraph">1- To find a sustainable, independent, and environmentally friendly solution to the energy problem in Gaza, replacing old energy sources either partially or entirely, which will lower electricity prices for citizens and ensure continuous operation.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">2- To solve the problems of wave power generators, replacing environmentally harmful materials with eco-friendly and recyclable alternatives.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">3- To find an innovative method for the early detection of natural disasters such as tsunamis and underwater earthquakes.</p>
